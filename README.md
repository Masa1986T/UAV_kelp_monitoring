# UAV_kelp_monitoring
This repository provides datasets and R code for the analysis in "Rapid decline of temperate kelp forests revealed by unoccupied aerial vehicle (UAV) photography and underwater observations‚Äù by Masaaki Sato, Junji Kinoshita, Kyoji Ishita, Shiori Arima, Masayuki Fudo, Hisami Kuwahara to examine temporal changes in kelp forests at Manazuru in pacific coasts of Central Japan.  

The raw data described below are housed in the folder /data.

Make figure 2 for Water temperature at Enoura: Enoura_physical_variable.R
Make figure 3 for catch of herbivore fish: Herbivore_catch_seisho.R
Make figure 4 for Significant wave height at Shimoda: Wave_current_velocity.R
Make figure 4 for large typhoon tracks 2019: typhoon_track2019.R
Make figure 5 for cover of algal species, and perform multivariate analysis: Iwa_algal_community.R


To make figures or run the analyses, use the scripts below, which will source outputs from analyses done in the other scripts.
