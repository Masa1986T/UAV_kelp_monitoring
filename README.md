# UAV_kelp_monitoring
This repository provides datasets and R code for the analysis in Sato et al. (2025).

## Data
The raw data described below are housed in the folder /data.

- Make figure 2 for water temperature at Enoura: Enoura_wtemp5m_2008-2020.csv, Enoura_maxTemp_hist.csv, and Enoura_16cTemp_hist.csv
- Make figure 3 for catch of herbivore fish: Herbivore_setnet.csv
- Make figure 4 for Significant wave height at Shimoda: Shimoda_wave_2008-2020.csv
- Make figure 4 for large typhoon tracks 2019: typhoon_table2019.csv
- Make figure 5 for cover of algal species: Iwa_algae_data_2019-2020.csv
- Perform multivariate analysis with figure 5: Iwa_algal_community_multivariate.csv
- Sea-truth data in Iwa and Manazuru for mapping of kelp forests using UAV photos: Data_sea-truth.xlsx

## Results
The folder "res" includes results of figures obtained by running codes below.

## Codes
To make figures or run the analyses, use the scripts below. 

- Make figure 2 for water temperature at Enoura: Enoura_physical_variable.R
